# Lenore UI

Beautiful, customizable and easy to use UI widgets to help me (or maybe you) develop my (or maybe your) apps faster. This is my personal package that I use to develop my apps with. Its helps me to build them quickly without worrying about the UI difficulties. 

I am developing this package and adding widgets to it but I am doing as I need it. I don't expect anyone using this, but if you do use it and want something implemented in, contact me to add them or make a request on github (makes me happy :)).
